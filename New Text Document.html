      <h1>Shahrokh's Special Recipes for Nowruz 2024</h1>

      <h2>March 20th: Baghali Polo with Persian Lamb Shanks</h2>
      <p class="comment">
        Baghali Polo is a fragrant Persian rice dish that features fava beans,
        dill and saffron. It’s traditionally served with lamb shanks (mahicheh),
        but it’s also popular alongside other meats and stews. The technique for
        cooking Baghali Polo is similar to that for rice with tahdig, where the
        rice forms the crispy topping. In this version of the dish, a layer of
        potato slices becomes the crispy tahdig. You can find frozen green fava
        beans in some supermarkets and stores specializing in Middle Eastern and
        Mediterranean ingredients; canned brown fava beans have a different
        texture and flavor, so they aren’t a good substitute in this recipe.

        <p class="comment">Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon saffron</li>
          <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
          <li>Kosher salt</li>
          <li>1 pound frozen fava beans, partially thawed (see cook's note)</li>
          <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
          <li>2 small bunches fresh dill, chopped (about 1 cup chopped)</li>
          <li>
            2 small russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices
          </li>
          <li>3 tablespoons dry dill</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="comment">Directions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Grind the saffron in a mortar and pestle. Sprinkle it over 2 cubes
            of ice in a cup and let the ice melt; this blooms the saffron.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rinse the basmati rice 3 to 5 times until the water runs almost
            clear. Bring a large wide pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add
            1 tablespoon salt and the rice. Cook for 6 minutes. Add the fava
            beans and fresh dill and cook for 1 more minute. Drain into a
            colander, rinse quickly with cold water and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the oil into the same pot. Add 1 tablespoon of the bloomed
            saffron. Arrange the potato slices in one single layer at the bottom
            of the pot. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Gently add half of
            the rice, sprinkle the dried dill over the rice and top with the
            remaining half of the rice. Shape the rice into a mound. Poke 5
            holes into the rice with the end of a spoon to let excess steam to
            escape. Wrap the lid of the pot in a clean kitchen towel and place
            it on the pot. Put the pot over medium heat and cook until the rice
            starts steaming, about 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour 1/4 cup water around the edges of the pan, cover and cook until
            the potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 more minutes. Drizzle the
            remaining bloomed saffron over the rice, cover and cook for 5 more
            minutes. Turn the heat off and let the rice sit for 5 minutes before
            serving. To serve, gently scoop the rice onto a serving platter and
            arrange the cooked potato slices around the rice.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="comment">
          <strong>Cook’s Note:</strong> Some frozen fava beans come with a white
          outer skin still encasing each bean. If yours do, use your fingers to
          remove the skins before adding the beans to the rice.

      <h3>Persian Lamb Shanks:</h3>

        <p class="comment">
          Lamb Shanks, known as Mahicheh in Farsi, have a special place in
          Persian cuisine. They’re usually served for weddings and other special
          occasions like Ramadan and Nowruz, typically alongside Baghali Polo.
          The lamb shanks are cooked for a few hours with aromatics, then slowly
          braised in a tomato sauce to absorb all the flavors and until the meat
          is so tender that it falls off the bone.
        </p>

        <p class="comment">Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lamb:</strong></li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon ground saffron</li>
          <li>4 lamb shanks (12 to 16 ounces each)</li>
          <li>1 large onion, peeled and quartered</li>
          <li>1 head garlic</li>
          <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
          <li>6 cardamom pods</li>
          <li>2 bay leaves</li>
          <li>Kosher salt</li>
          <li><strong>Tomato Sauce:</strong></li>
          <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
          <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
          <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="comment">Directions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            For the lamb: Sprinkle the saffron over 3 ice cubes in a bowl and
            let them melt at room temperature; this blooms the saffron. Place
            the lamb shanks in a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over
            high heat and cook for 25 minutes; white or brown foam will collect
            on the surface. Take the lamb shanks out of the pot and discard that
            water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the lamb shanks back in the pot and add the onion, garlic,
            cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, bay leaves and 1 tablespoon salt.
            Add water to cover the shanks by about 1 1/2 inches. Place the pot
            over high heat, bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium and simmer
            until the lamb is very tender, about 4 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, for the tomato sauce: Melt the butter in large saucepan
            over medium heat. Add the olive oil. Add the onions and cook,
            stirring frequently, until they are golden, about 15 minutes. Add
            the tomato paste and cook until aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add the
            garlic powder, turmeric, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1/4
            teaspoon black pepper and cook 5 minutes longer. Pour in enough
            water to cover the lamb shanks, 6 to 8 cups. Increase the heat to
            medium high and bring it to a simmer. Adjust the heat and simmer 15
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the lamb from the pot and add it to the tomato sauce. Cook
            over medium heat, uncovered, until the sauce has reduced to half and
            the lamb is so tender it falls off the bone, about 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the bloomed saffron to the pot and cook for 10 more minutes.
            Taste and add more salt and pepper and serve.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <strong>Cook’s Note:</strong> You can double or triple this recipe
          easily, just remember that with a larger quantity cooking times may
          increase slightly. While this dish is traditionally served with the
          fava bean and dill rice, you can serve it with white rice as well.
