    <h2>What Makes This Fried Chicken So Crispy?</h2>
    <p>
      There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:<br />
      · Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like
      consistency is key <br />
      to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside.<br />
      · Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying
      process.<br />
      This one, however, only starts at a very high heat — after browning, the
      heat is<br />
      reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again at the
      end, locking in that crispy texture. <br />
      · Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with
      browning the chicken.

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
      <dd>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</dd>
      <br />
      <br />

      <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are
        cooking dictate <br />
        the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and
        pepper to taste <br />
        (paprika helps to brown the chicken).
      </dd>
      <br />
      <br />

      <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the
        bag with the flour,<br />
        seal the bag and shake to coat well.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a
        clean dish towel or waxed paper.<br />
        LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS
        CRUCIAL!<br />
        seal the bag and shake to coat well.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <br />

      <dt><b>Step 5</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with
        vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <br />

      <dt><b>Step 6</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken
        in HOT oil on both sides.<br />

      </dd>
      <br />
      <br />

      <dt><b>Step 7</b></dt>
      <dd>
        When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes
        (the chicken will be cooked through <br />
        but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry
        until crispy.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <br />

      <dt><b>Step 8</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken
        you have, you may have to fry in a<br />
        few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while
        preparing the rest.
