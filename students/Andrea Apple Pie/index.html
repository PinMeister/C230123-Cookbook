    <h4>How to Make an Apple Pie</h4>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this
      old-fashioned apple pie at home:
    </p>
    <p>
      Step1: Make the filling: On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter.
      Add the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from
      heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step2: Assemble the pie: Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the
      sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice
      crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over
      the lattice crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step3: Bake the pie: Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are
      soft and the crust is golden brown.
    </p>

    <h4>How Long to Bake Apple Pie</h4>
    <p>
      You'll bake the pie at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then you'll reduce
      the temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking for 35-45 minutes.
      All in all, the pie will bake for about one hour, give or take a few
      minutes. You'll know the pie is done when the apples are soft and the
      crust is a beautiful golden brown color.
